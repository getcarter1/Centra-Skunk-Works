# Centra-Skunk-Works
Glorified Stop-Watch.
Initially tested on Arduino UNO and other ATMEL 328P microcontroller breakout boards.
Generic enough at the moment to compile for most other ATMEL micros.
Should be easily ported to STM32 microcontrollers at need.
This is a work in-progress. No assumptions should be made as to the effectiveness of this code, or, for that matter, it's Author.
